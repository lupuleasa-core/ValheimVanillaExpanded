## How to install:

1. Install Valheim on Steam

2. Download [r2modman from Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/), open it and select Valheim as the default game

3. Create a new profile (or go to "Settings > Profile > Change Profile > New Profile" if you are already on one)

4. Go to "Online" and search for "Vanilla Enhanced" and download it

5. Click "Start modded" and enjoy

Optionally: You can backup your world and characters by going to %APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim

## Theme of the Changes:

- Only changes that are true to the Valheim devs game vision. 

- Many QoL changes or bug fixes (read below).

- Changes that fit in Vanilla Valheim experience and lore.

- Changes that are stable and tested by me and the friends I play with.

- Changes that can be easily removed to convert world back to unmodded.

- No new building pieces. Buildings will still be vanilla.

- No changes that make the game too easy or too hard.

- No new monster types or biome (just wait for Valheim devs to expand vanilla naturally)

- Optionally, some mods that expand the endgame loot and enemies if you want to play a lot more
